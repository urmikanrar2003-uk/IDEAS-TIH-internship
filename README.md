Road accidents are not merely unfortunate events, they are a persistent and preventable global crisis that inflicts profound human, social, and economic costs. In India, the alarming frequency and severity of such incidents have positioned road safety as a critical public health and policy concern. With over 150,000 fatalities recorded annually, the nation faces an urgent need for intelligent, data-driven strategies to understand and mitigate the factors that contribute to accident severity.

To address this, our study employs a dual-layered analytical framework integrating supervised and deep learning and time series forecasting. We begin with extensive pre-processing and feature engineering on a **multi-source dataset (2018–2023)**, capturing granular accident-level attributes across temporal, geographic, infrastructural, vehicular, and human dimensions. For predictive classification, we have implemented **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** to model accident severity, rigorously evaluated via metrics such as **F1-score, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC**. Recognizing the volatility in daily data, we have extended our analysis to monthly aggregation and applied advanced forecasting models including **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** networks to capture temporal dependencies and generate forward-looking accident trends. This methodological synthesis not only enhances predictive robustness but also facilitates deeper insight into the dynamic nature of road safety in India.

**About Internship :**

As part of the **IDEAS-TIH, ISI Kolkata Summer Internship Program 2025**, we were fortunate to receive an intensive series of technical training sessions in the early weeks of the program. The carefully structured modules covered a wide array of foundational and advanced concepts, including **python programming, data visualization with Power BI, seaborn and matplotlib, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, supervised classification methods, sentiment analysis, generative artificial intelligence, large language model and as well as survey questionnaire designing**. Additionally, expert sessions on **industry trends, model evaluation metrics, and effective communication of insights** provided us with a well-rounded perspective on practical data science workflows.

These sessions played a pivotal role in equipping us with the technical fluency and analytical thinking required to undertake our project titled **“When Roads Speak: Unveiling the Pattern of Road Accidents in India”**. We applied our knowledge of Python for data preprocessing and wrangling, utilized visualization tools to explore accident trends, and implemented machine learning algorithms for predictive modelling. Furthermore, the training in statistical testing and time series forecasting enabled us to explore accident frequency trends using time series and deep learning models. The foundational instruction we received empowered us not only to execute technically sound methodologies but also to interpret results meaningfully thereby ensuring our project aligned with real-world impact and analytical rigor.
